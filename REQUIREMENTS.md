# Requirements.md

This is to be a comprehensive list of the application's desired functionality. List will be updated as needed.

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY

1. Ability to save user credentials (billing and shipping address, payment method) onto user's machine and retrieve credentials when executing a purchase
2. Ability to navigate a given webstore and accurately identify the desired product, add it to the user's cart, and checkout with the given credentials
3. Support for the most lightweight, efficient webbrowser (currently considering Opera)
4. Current list of to-be-supported websites:

> http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/mens-shoes/7puZoi3

> http://www.supremenewyork.com/shop

> http://www.adidas.com (extremely laggy with Firefox, perhaps Opera would fare better)

### ADDITIONAL FEATURES
List descending by priority

1. A highly reliable and efficient algorithm for matching products with keywords
2. Support for multithreading, with each thread connecting to a VPN to increase chances of a successful purchase
3. Support for additional well-known sneaker stores (ultimate goal is to create a universal bot)
4. Support for both guest and pre-made account checkout on the given site
5. Support for anti-bot measures (e.g. captcha)
