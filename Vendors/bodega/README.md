### bodegaSEL.py

Basic structure of the credit card input section on the checkout page is like this: <div><iframe><input></input></iframe><iframe>...</div>

div and each iframe are dynamic, so to avoid StaleElementReferenceExceptions you're going to have to manually examine when the div and iframes change based on what you type in the fields.
